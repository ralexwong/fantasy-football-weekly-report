# Fantasy-football-weekly-report

This app is aimed towards commissioners of fantasy football leagues who want to make things more fun. Or those who like looking at leaderboards/stats. 

## How it works

<ul>
  <li>You pick which platform your league is in and what week you want the recap to show</li>
  <li>Depending on the platform you may need to provide more information such as username or league ID</li>
  <li>Press submit and the app will pull your leagues info through the API and download it into our database</li>
  <li>It will then pull from the database and display the stats on the screen!</li>
  <li>For now, you will need to take a screenshot of the page. But a `print to pdf` button will eventually make its way into this app to make things easier</li>
</ul>

## Roadmap


The site will only be compatiatible with sleeper leagues for now. I want to have a working app before i start to integrate more platforms. Eventually ESPN and YAHOO leagues will work with this app.
